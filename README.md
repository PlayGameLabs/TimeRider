Game of simulation of archaeological researches and Virtual Archaeological Museum.

I currently provide consulting services in the area of ​​Information Technology in the form of maintenance contracts and freelancing and I am developing projects in the area of ​​digital games.
I have some prototypes under development in the area of ​​Indie games, so my portfolio in this area is still restricted in this area.
I am currently studying Game Designer at SAGA (School of Game Development, Digital Art, Design and Visual Effects) one of the most prestigious schools in the area of ​​digital game development, although I have been familiar and enthusiastic for many years, Only in the last four years could I dedicate myself to projects in the area of ​​Games Development.
I am generalist and the tools I use most are Photoshop, Maya, Mudbox, MotionBuilder, Dazstudio 4.9 Pro, Zbrush, 3DStudio Max, Autodesk Character Studio, Movie Maker among others. The engine I use most is Unity 3d 5 and I'm starting training on UDK 4 and Blender 2.8.
The prototype in development presents the archaeological site with real scenery, the topology and structures reproduce the Giza Plateau in Egypt, the creation of the scenario was based on real model, was textured and modeled by me, as well as lighting and programming.

My goal is to distribute it on various platforms as an archeology simulator and to develop another museum visitation application that can be used by researchers, professional archaeologists, enthusiasts and as entertainment for the public, allowing the player to know details of various monuments that awaken The curiosity for the mystery that surrounds its origin.
In the current technology of the engine of Unity 3D 5 it is possible to compile the prototype for Virtual Reality, which would bring an extremely realistic experience for the player or researcher.
